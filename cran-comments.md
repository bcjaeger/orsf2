R CMD check succeeded

## Downstream dependencies

I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of `aorsf`: 

- Rcpp
- data.table. 

Both packages passed.

Updates: 

- ensured all links use https instead of http and have added trailing slashes where appropriate.

- added a reference to `DESCRIPTION` that discusses the methods used in `aorsf`.
