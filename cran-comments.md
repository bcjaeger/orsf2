With the help of a colleague, I was able to reproduce the undefined behavior error. I am confident that it is now resolved.

I understand you are taking an extended break from reviewing this package and I'm comfortable waiting until the break is concluded. Thank you for everything you do.

I saw that it took a long time to run tests on my last submission. I added rules to skip tests on CRAN that require longer run times. I hope this is helpful.
