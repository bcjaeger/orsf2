\title{ORSF variable importance}
\usage{
orsf_vi_negate(object, group_factors = TRUE, oobag_fun = NULL, ...)

orsf_vi_permute(object, group_factors = TRUE, oobag_fun = NULL, ...)

orsf_vi_anova(object, group_factors = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class 'aorsf'.}

\item{group_factors}{(\emph{logical}) if \code{TRUE}, the importance of factor
variables will be reported overall by aggregating the importance
of individual levels of the factor. If \code{FALSE}, the importance of
individual factor levels will be returned.}

\item{oobag_fun}{(\emph{function}) When \code{oobag_fun} = \code{NULL} (the default),
out-of-bag predictions are evaluated using Harrell's C-statistic.
If a value for \code{oobag_fun} is provided, it will be used in place of
Harrell's C-statistic to evaluate out-of-bag predictions. See details.}

\item{...}{not currently used.}
}
\value{
a named vector. Names indicate predictors, values indicate importance.
The vector is sorted from highest to lowest value, with higher values
indicating higher importance.
}
\description{
Determine the importance of individual variables using 'negation
importance.' See 'Details' for definition of negation importance.
}
\details{
\strong{negation importance}: Each variable is assessed separately by
multiplying the variable's coefficients by -1 and then determining
how much the model's performance changes. The worse the model's
performance after negating coefficients for a given variable,
the more important the variable.

\strong{ANOVA importance}: ANOVA importance computes a p-value for each
coefficient in each linear combination of variables in each decision
tree of an oRF. Following the definition proposed by Menze et al,
ANOVA importance in aorsf for an individual variable is the proportion
of times a p-value for its coefficient is < 0.10.

\strong{Disclaimer}: Negation importance is currently in development and its routine may be tweaked in future updates. ANOVA importance has been published by Menze et al. and is in a more stable lifecycle than negation importance.
