Description: Fit, interpret, and make predictions with oblique random
    survival forests. Oblique decision trees are notoriously slow compared
    to their axis based counterparts, but 'aorsf' runs as fast or faster
    than axis-based decision tree algorithms for right-censored
    time-to-event outcomes. Methods to accelerate and interpret the
    oblique random survival forest are described in Jaeger et al., (2023)
