Begin by fitting an ORSF ensemble:

```{r, child = 'orsf-fit-accelerated.Rmd'}

```

## Individual conditional expectations two ways

You can compute individual conditional expectations two ways using a random forest:

- using out-of-bag predictions for the training data

  ```{r}
  
  pd_spec <- list(bili = seq(1, 6, length.out = 10))
  
  ice_train <- orsf_ice_oob(fit, pd_spec)
  
  ice_train
  
  ```

- using predictions for a new set of data

  ```{r}
  
  ice_test <- orsf_ice_new(fit, 
                           new_data = pbc_orsf_test, 
                           pd_spec = pd_spec)
  
  ice_test
  
  ```
