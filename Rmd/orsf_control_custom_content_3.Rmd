## Evaluate

How well do our two customized ORSFs do? Let's compute their indices of prediction accuracy based on out-of-bag predictions:

```{r}

library(riskRegression)
library(survival)

risk_preds <- list(rando = 1 - fit_rando$surv_oobag,
                    pca = 1 - fit_pca$surv_oobag)

sc <- Score(object = risk_preds, 
            formula = Surv(time, status) ~ 1, 
            data = pbc_orsf, 
            summary = 'IPA',
            times = fit_pca$pred_horizon)

```

The PCA ORSF does quite well! (higher IPA is better)

```{r}

sc$Brier

```
