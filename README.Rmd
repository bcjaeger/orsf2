Fit, interpret, and make predictions with oblique random forests (RFs).  

## Why aorsf?

- Hundreds of times faster than other software for oblique RFs.^1^

- Accurate predictions.^2^

- Computes partial dependence and variable importance.^2^

- Intuitive API with formula based interface.

- Extensive input checks and informative error messages.

## Installation
You can install `aorsf` from CRAN using

``` r
install.packages("aorsf")
```


You can install the development version of aorsf from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/aorsf")
```

## What is an oblique decision tree?

Decision trees are grown by splitting a set of training data into non-overlapping subsets, with the goal of having more similarity within the new subsets than between them. When subsets are created with a single predictor, the decision tree is *axis-based* because the subset boundaries are perpendicular to the axis of the predictor. When linear combinations (i.e., a weighted sum) of variables are used instead of a single variable, the tree is *oblique* because the boundaries are neither parallel nor perpendicular to the axis. 

**Figure**: Decision trees for classification with axis-based splitting (left) and oblique splitting (right). Cases are orange squares; controls are purple circles. Both trees partition the predictor space defined by variables X1 and X2, but the oblique splits do a better job of separating the two classes.


```{r fig_oblique_v_axis, out.width='100%', echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/tree_axis_v_oblique.png')

```

## Examples

`orsf()` fits several types of oblique RFs. My personal favorite is the accelerated oblique survival RF because it has a great combination of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency (see [JCGS paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2023.2231048)).^2^

```{r, child='Rmd/orsf-fit-accelerated.Rmd'}

```

### Inspect

Printing the output from `orsf()` will give some information and descriptive statistics about the ensemble.

```{r}

fit

```

- See [print.ObliqueForest](https://docs.ropensci.org/aorsf/reference/print.orsf_fit.html) for a description of each line in the printed output.

- See [orsf examples](https://docs.ropensci.org/aorsf/reference/orsf.html#examples) for more details on controlling ORSF ensemble fits and using them in prediction modeling workflows.

### Variable importance

The importance of individual variables can be estimated in three ways using `aorsf`:

- **negation**^2^: `r aorsf:::roxy_vi_describe('negate')`

  ```{r}
  
  orsf_vi_negate(fit)
  
  ```

- **permutation**: `r aorsf:::roxy_vi_describe('permute')`

  ```{r}
  
  orsf_vi_permute(fit)
  
  ```
  
- **analysis of variance (ANOVA)**^3^: `r aorsf:::roxy_vi_describe('anova')`

  ```{r}
  
  orsf_vi_anova(fit)
  
  ```

You can supply your own R function to estimate out-of-bag error when using negation or permutation importance (see [oob vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/aorsf/articles/oobag.html))

### Partial dependence (PD) 

`r aorsf:::roxy_pd_explain()`

The summary function, `orsf_summarize_uni()`, computes PD for as many variables as you ask it to, using sensible values.

```{r}

orsf_summarize_uni(fit, n_variables = 2)

```


For more on PD, see the [vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/aorsf/articles/pd.html)

### Individual conditional expectations (ICE)

`r aorsf:::roxy_ice_explain()`


For more on ICE, see the [vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/aorsf/articles/pd.html#individual-conditional-expectations-ice)

## Comparison to existing software

Comparisons between `aorsf` and existing software are presented in our [JCGS paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2023.2231048). The paper:

- describes `aorsf` in detail with a summary of the procedures used in the tree fitting algorithm 

- runs a general benchmark comparing `aorsf` with `obliqueRSF` and several other learners 

- reports prediction accuracy and computational efficiency of all learners.

- runs a simulation study comparing variable importance techniques with oblique survival RFs, axis based survival RFs, and boosted trees.

- reports the probability that each variable importance technique will rank a relevant variable with higher importance than an irrelevant variable.

A more hands-on comparison of `aorsf` and other R packages is provided in [orsf examples](https://docs.ropensci.org/aorsf/reference/orsf.html#tidymodels)
