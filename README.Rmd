`aorsf` provides optimized software to fit, interpret, and make predictions with oblique random survival forests (ORSFs).  


## Why aorsf?

- Hundreds of times faster than `obliqueRSF`.^1^

- Fast and accurate predictions for censored outcomes.^2^

- negation importance, a novel technique to estimate variable importance for ORSFs.^2^

- intuitive API with formula based interface.

- extensive input checks + informative error messages.

## Installation

You can install the development version of aorsf from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcjaeger/aorsf")
```

## Example

The `orsf()` function is used to fit ORSF ensembles: 

```{r}

library(aorsf)

fit <- orsf(data = pbc_orsf, 
            formula = Surv(time, status) ~ . - id)

```

The default routine to fit ORSF ensembles is the 'accelerated' ORSF - an algorithm based on Newton Raphson scoring that does very well in benchmarks of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.^2^ In addition to the accelerated ORSF, `aorsf` can fit a broad range of ORSF ensembles (see ORSF CONTROL VIGNETTE (not yet written)). 

### Inspect

Printing the output from `orsf()` will give some descriptive statistics about the ensemble.

```{r}

print(fit)

```

### Variable importance

The importance of individual variables can be estimated in three ways using `aorsf`:

- **negation**: `r aorsf:::roxy_vi_describe('negate')`

  ```{r}
  
  orsf_vi_negate(fit)
  
  ```

- **permutation**: `r aorsf:::roxy_vi_describe('permute')`

  ```{r}
  
  orsf_vi_permute(fit)
  
  ```
  
- **analysis of variance (ANOVA)^3^**: `r aorsf:::roxy_vi_describe('anova')`

  ```{r}
  
  orsf_vi_anova(fit)
  
  ```

You can also supply your own R function to estimate out-of-bag error when using negation or permutation importance (see [oob vignette](https://bcjaeger.github.io/aorsf/articles/oobag.html)). 

### Partial dependence

`aorsf` can generate individual conditional expectation (ICE) and partial dependence: 

- ICE is the expected predicted value for an individual observation. ICE can be used to show how the prediction for an observation changes when a predictor changes.

- partial dependence is a multi-variable adjusted expected predicted value of an ORSF ensemble.

  ```{r}
  
  orsf_pd(fit, pd_spec = list(bili = c(1:5)))
  
  ```


- use `orsf_summarize_uni()` to show the top predictor variables in an ORSF model and the expected predicted risk at specific values of those predictors. (The term 'uni' is short for univariate.)

  ```{r}

  # take a look at the top 5 variables 
  # for continuous predictors, see expected risk at 25/50/75th quantile
  # for categorical predictors, see expected risk in specified category

  orsf_summarize_uni(object = fit, n_variables = 5)

  ```

## Comparison to existing software

Jaeger (2022) describes `aorsf` in detail, with a summary of the procedures used in the tree fitting algorithm and a general benchmark comparing `aorsf` with `obliqueRSF` (and several other learners) in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
