`aorsf` provides optimized software to fit, interpret, and make predictions with oblique random survival forests (ORSFs).  


## Why aorsf?

- Hundreds of times faster than `obliqueRSF` (see Jaeger, 2019).

- accurate predictions for time-to-event outcomes.

- negation importance, a novel technique to estimate variable importance for ORSFs.

- intuitive API with formula based interface.

- extensive input checks + informative error messages.

## Installation

You can install the development version of aorsf from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcjaeger/aorsf")
```
## Example

The `orsf()` function is used to fit ORSFs. Printing the output from `orsf()` will give some descriptive statistics about the ensemble.

```{r example}

library(aorsf)

fit <- orsf(data = pbc_orsf,
            formula = Surv(time, status) ~ . - id)

print(fit)

```

How about interpreting the fit? 

- use `orsf_vi_negate()` and `orsf_vi_anova()` for variable importance

  ```{r}
  
  orsf_vi_negate(fit)
  
  ```

- use `orsf_pd_ice()` or `orsf_pd_summary()` for individual or aggregated partial dependence values. 

  ```{r}
  
  orsf_pd_summary(fit, pd_spec = list(bili = c(1:5)))
  
  ```


- use `orsf_summarize_uni()` to show the top predictor variables in an ORSF model and the expected predicted risk at specific values of those predictors. (The term 'uni' is short for univariate.)

  ```{r}

  # take a look at the top 5 variables 
  # for continuous predictors, see expected risk at 25/50/75th quantile
  # for categorical predictors, see expected risk in specified category

  orsf_summarize_uni(object = fit, n_variables = 5)

  ```

## Comparison to existing software

Jaeger (2022) describes `aorsf` in detail, with a summary of the procedures used in the tree fitting algorithm and a general benchmark comparing `aorsf` with `obliqueRSF` (and several other learners) in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
